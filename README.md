# JEEPal
A chatbot for JEE powered by Deep Learning

This is a really simple chatbot that I had created. It uses a simple bag of words model, to classify intents of user inputs and replies accordingly. 
A lot of improvement can be done.

To run this chatbot:
Create a virtual environment, and then run:

* pip install -r requirements.txt


* python chat.py

This will start a flask server.

### Usage

For interacting with the bot, type this in your browser: http://localhost:[PORT]/chat?q=[QUERY]
